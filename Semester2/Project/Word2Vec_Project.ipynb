    "## Why do we need word embeddings ?\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing NLP, we are generally interested in being able to transform sentences or words into numeric representations, to then feed them to our algorithms and perform predictions.  Some simple methods of doing so include using term frequencies or n-grams among other things (counting the number of times a word appears in positive tweets vs. negative tweets for example)...  While these simple approaches can work quite well in some cases, sentences are essentially represented as \"Bags of Words\", meaning a lot of information is lost : sentence structure, semantics, what the usual context for a word is.  The word *cat* for example may be frequently accompanied by *a* or *the* to its left since it's a noun.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we find more expressive numeric representations ?  This question motivated NLP researchers to create more sophisticated word representations, known as *word embeddings*.  These are *dense* vectors (vs. *sparse* vectors : vectors with high dimensionality where most of the values are 0s) and are now fundamental to any machine learning algorithm in NLP."

    "## What principle do these word embeddings rely on ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating word embeddings relies on the idea that \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" (Firth, 1957). In [distributional semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics#Distributional_Hypothesis), the distributional hypothesis tells us that words which occur and are used in the same context are semantically similar to one another.  The word vectors (embeddings) created take into account this contextual information, and ideally, the resulting vectors for words that have *similar contexts* end up in the same area of the vector space :\n",

    "## The Word2Vec Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This model was created by Google in 2013 and is a predictive deep learning based model :  given neighboring words, the neural network has to *predict* the word to be found at the center (this is only one of the possible architectures).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, this model can leverage raw text (meaning no manual annotations needed), create a vocabulary of possible words and generate dense word embeddings for each word. We can even specify the size of the word embedding vectors, which makes the dimensionality of the vectors much lower than the high-dimensional sparse vectors built using traditional Bag of Words models.\n",

    "To create word embeddings, you need a corpus and a learning algorithm, a simple neural net in this case.  The embeddings are a set of vectors that will be extracted from the neural net once it is trained, and are actually a *by-product* of the following task : the main objective of the CBOW model is to predict a missing word based on its surrounding words.  The intuition is that updating the values in the vectors (that we will be extracting) based on this task yields vectors that capture distributional semantics, ie. how these words are used in language, and make good word embedings.\n",

    "Pytorch allows you to implement a special layer, called an embedding layer (`nn.Embedding`).  This special layer serves as a look-up table, mapping token indexes to vectors (**Embeddings**).  By default, the values in these vectors will be updated by the model with respect to our goal, which is to predict a token given the tokens surrouding it.  These 'trained' embeddings should therefore contain *distributional semantic* information that can be extracted from words appearing in the same context, which is what we're after.  Look at the the documentation to see what this layer takes as inputs : https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Embedding.html\n",

    "This batch must first go through the embedding layer which returns 4 vectors (1 for each word) of equal dimension for each example in the batch.  With a batch size of 128 and an embedding dimension of 50, the shape of the output of the `nn.Embedding` layer will be:  (128, 4, 50):  128 matrices (one per example in the batch) of 4 by 50 (one 50 dimensional vector per context word).\n",

    "For each example in the batch, you will compute the average these 4 vectors to obtain a single vector.  This means you must specify that the mean calculated has to be along dimension 1 (the one equal to 4).  This is why the model is called Continuous Bag of Words: we don’t consider the order of the context words when averaging their embeddings in this way; that information is lost.\n",
